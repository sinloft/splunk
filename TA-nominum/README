===Nominum Technology Add-on===

   Version/Date: 1.0  03.10.2012

   Supported product(s): Vantio

   Source type(s): nominum:vantio

   Input requirements: 
      Make sure that your vantio log has the sourcetype 'nominum:vantio' -> this is the easy, therefore the recommended way
      If you write your vantio log data to syslog (and mingle-mangle it with a lot of other stuff) you have to create the nominum:vantio sourcetype 
      Something like this will work:
      props.conf  
         [syslog]
         TRANSFORM-sourcetype = set_sourcetype_for_nominum_vantio


      transforms.conf
         [set_sourcetype_for_nominum_vantio]
         REGEX = Vantio
         FORMAT = sourcetype::nominum:vantio
         DEST_KEY = MetaData:Sourcetype
