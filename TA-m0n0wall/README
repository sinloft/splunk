   Input requirements: Syslog'ing to a remote syslog server has to be enabled on the m0n0wall to receive events.
                       It is recommended to write the logs to file locally and then read them (via a forwarder or on the indexer directly)
                       that way you do not loose (fire & forget udp) data when the indexer has an outage Splunk will just start 
                       indexing where it stopped.
