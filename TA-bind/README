===Product Name Technology Add-on===

   Author: Chris Wiederkehr

   Version/Date: 0.1 September 2012

   Supported product(s): Bind 9.9 (maybe 9.x)

   Source type(s): bind (queries,xfer-out,xfer-in,security),syslog (queries)

   Input requirements: Bind has to log its events ... either to syslog (ok,easy) or to a seperate log (I like,takes a little more time,easier to work with later on)


   ===Using this Technology Add-on===

   Configuration: Manual

   If you just want the query logs then this will toggle (turn on/turn off) query logging to syslog:
   # rndc querylog

   You can configure bind to log different categories of logs to a (or many)  file(s). This is what I used in my named.conf:
        logging{
          channel simple_log {
          file "/var/log/named/bind.log" versions 3 size 100m;
          # choose how much detail you want: critical, error, warning, notice,  info,  debug [level], dynamic
          # info was ok for the tests I made...
          severity info;        
          print-time yes;
          print-severity yes;
          print-category yes;
          };
          channel syslog {
           syslog daemon;       # send to syslog's daemon facility
           severity info;       # choose how much detail you want

          };
          category queries{
            simple_log;
            syslog;
          };
          category security{
            simple_log;
          };
          category xfer-out{
            simple_log;
          };
          category xfer-in{
            simple_log;
          };
        };
